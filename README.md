## 🎓 Final Project: Land Cover Segmentation

This is the capstone project of the NTI Computer Vision internship.

The task involves segmenting satellite imagery into multiple land cover classes using semantic segmentation models.

**Implemented Models**:
- UNet from scratch
- VGG16-based UNet (encoder-decoder)

**Objective**:
Classify each pixel in satellite images into categories like urban areas, agriculture, forest, water, barren land, etc.
